This game of Ultimate Hangman provides the user with three optional catagories to choose from. Depending on their choice the words will be related to that catagory. They are then given three further options to select the difficulty level they require, easy, where they will get 8 guesses, medium, where they will get 6 guesses and hard where they will only get 3 guesses. The selected catagory word is hidden behind - - - and the user is invited to have a guess at a letter. If they get it correct the hidden word will reveal where that letter fits into the word and they will be invited to have another go. If the user guesses incorrectly they will be informed of their choice and a list of letters they have already guessed. A picture of the hangman will be displayed along with the number of guesses they have remaining. Once the user has guessed the word or had failed to guess the word they will be informed of the result, the word they were trying to guess and receive an invitiation to play again or not.
